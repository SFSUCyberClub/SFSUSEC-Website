# About

Hello, we are a group of individuals curious about the world of cybersecurity. We would like to explore the endless 
possibilities it has on its plate. We're a small community at SFSU, but we hold tight bonds. On this site you will find details
on our scheduling, blog posts, and resources created by the workshops we've organized. Without the club members, we are 
simply a dust in the wind. If you would ever like to join us in the future you're more then welcome to.
